    <h3>Begging the Claim</h3>
    <p>The conclusion that the writer should prove is validated within the claim. Example: Filthy and polluting coal should be banned.
    Arguing that coal pollutes the earth and thus should be banned would be logical. But the very conclusion that should
    be proved, that coal causes enough pollution to warrant banning its use, is already assumed in the claim by referring
    to it as "filthy and polluting."</p>
